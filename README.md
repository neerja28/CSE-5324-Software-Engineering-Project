# A class project on Catering System. 


Goal: Create, explain, and critique software products.

This is a team project. A team consists of five to six students. To make collaboration as easy as possible, we are encouraged (but not required) to use a free open-source project hosting service such as Google Code, GitHub, or Bitbucket. Although an Android project is developed, the class emphasis is on the software engineering concepts presented in class. The project will be graded based on how well we use these techniques. The project demonstrated must be working at the end of the semester.

The project consists of three iterations. After each iteration, each team will present some aspects of their project, both in writing and by oral presentation. The first two iterations will not be formally graded but comments will be provided to help with the final iteration which will be graded. We had to distribute project work fairly among ourselves.

For each project-related deliverable, written or oral, each team would receive a team score. The sum of these team scores
determined the majority of our project-related grade.
